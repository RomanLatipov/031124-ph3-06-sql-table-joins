# SQL Table Relationships

## Learning Goals

- Introducing domain modeling for table relationships

- One to many relationships

- Many to many relationships

- Foreign keys

- The JOIN keyword

## Getting Started

We currently have four tables:

```
cats (name)
toys (name)
doctors (name, specialty)
patients (name)
```

Once you've cloned the repository, you'll be able to open it in sqlite3 with `sqlite3 main.db`.

## Terminal Output

This section will be populated post-lecture
